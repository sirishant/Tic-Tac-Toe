# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
Simple(-ish) Tic Tac Toe game using C++.

My first complete project. 

Concepts such as functions linked with external header files, strings, vectors, conditional operators, loops, etc are used.

Contains exit parameters for various foul-plays or incorrect inputs by the user. 
Returns as a draw game by default, or checks if a winning move is made after each input and returns the winner if made.

Took a few hours to make, and a lot of head scratching. Works fine enough for a newbie, I guess.
